Description:
       Anemone bulbs often benefit from a pre-planting soak to get them
 ready to grow. Before you head out to the garden to plant soak your 
anemone bulbs for 2-4 hours or overnight in a small bowl of water. 
This will encourage them to sprout faster and get growing so they develop
 a good network of roots their first autumn in the garden.
