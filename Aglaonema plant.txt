Description:
   The aglaonema is a highly decorative plant with several interesting 
varieties. There seems to be a little controversy in the books 
over whether this plant is easy or difficult to grow. 
The simple rule to follow is this: the lighter the variegation, the more 
light it needs. Otherwise, these are slow growing, dependably attractive 
and make excellent foliage plants.
