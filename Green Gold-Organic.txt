Overview

Earthworm Infusion is a complete, nutrient rich fertilizer that is produced naturally by 
earthworms. Earth worm castings are one of the most dynamic constituents that one 
could add to soil or soilless mixes. Vermicompost holds a complete array of water 
soluble micro and macro nutrients that diversifies the organic nature of the root zone 
by adding beneficial bacteria and helps the plant stay hydrated by holding 3 to 4 times 
its weight in water! This product can be used on all indoor and outdoor plants, even the 
most sensitive!
