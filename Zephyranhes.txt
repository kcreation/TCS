Description:
            Zephyranthes is a genus of temperate and tropical plants in the Amaryllis family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae,native to the Western Hemisphere and widely cultivated as ornamentals. There are over 70 recognized species,as well as numerous hybrids and cultivars. Common names for species in this genus include fairy lily, rainflower, zephyr lily, magic lily, Atamasco lily, and rain lily.The name is derived from ??f???? (Zephyrus), the Greek god of the west wind, and ????? (anthos), meaning flower, referring to the slender stalks.
                 These perennial bulbs (geophytes) tolerate many ecological niches (periodically wet soil to desert conditions), and have many ornamental characteristics. Many parts of the plant including the leaves and bulbs are considered to be toxic. The genus has been evaluated for possible medicinal properties, and the biochemically toxic compounds are classed as alkaloids.
                                                    Currently these plants are commonly cultivated in USDA hardiness zones 7–10. Rain lily breeders may develop cultivars with greater cold hardness.Generally rain lilies are sold in nurseries already potted up. This is of benefit since the growth cycle is not interrupted. Rarely (and not ideally), dried bulbs are marketed. Such dried bulbs usually become established after one to two growing seasons and will regain bloom vigor.
