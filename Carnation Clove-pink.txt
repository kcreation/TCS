Description:
          Dianthus caryophyllus, carnation or clove pink, is a species of Dianthus. It is probably native to the Mediterranean region but its exact range is unknown due to extensive cultivation for the last 2,000 years.It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 80 cm tall. The leaves are glaucous greyish green to blue-green, slender, up to 15 cm long. The flowers are produced singly or up to five together in a cyme; they are 3–5 cm diameter, and sweetly scented; the original natural flower colour is bright pinkish-purple, but cultivars of other colours, including red, white, yellow and green, have been developed.
                                                               Carnations require well-drained, neutral to slightly alkaline soil, and full spoon. Numerous cultivars have been selected for garden planting.Typical examples include 'Gina Porto', 'Helen', 'Laced Romeo', and 'Red Rocket'.Colombia is the largest carnation producer in the world.
