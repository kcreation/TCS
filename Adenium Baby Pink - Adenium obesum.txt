Description:
      Adenium obesum is grown as a houseplant in temperate regions.Numerous 
hybrids have been developed.Adeniums are appreciated for their colorful
flowers.They can be grown for many years in a pot and are commonly used for 
bonsai.Because seed-grown plants are not genetically identical to the mother 
plant,desirable varieties are commonly propagated by grafting. Genetically 
identical plants can also be propagated by cutting. However, cutting-grown 
plants do not tend to develop desirable thick caudex like seed-grown plants.
